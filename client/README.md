# 23 Final Project "NAIL LOUNGE OF LA JOLLA": MERN Stack Single-Page Application

For our final project, our client was in desperate need of new webpage. The old site was outdated and not reflective of the stellar services they provide to all who come in for a little rest and relaxation.

Our mission was to design a full stack application that provided a welcoming and user-friendly site that enhances the over experience of booking the users next nail or waxing service with ease.


## User Story (provided in the Final Project instructions from week 23)
```
Projects have played a key role in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. As you apply for development jobs, your portfolio is absolutely vital to opening doors to opportunities. Your portfolio showcases high-quality deployed examples of your work, and you can use your finished projects for that very purpose.

This project is a fantastic opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, especially in the context of a scalable, user-focused MERN app. Remember that employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job.

```

## Acceptance Criteria (provided in the Final Project instructions from week 23)
```
Your group will use everything youâ€™ve learned throughout this course to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand. This project will provide you with the best opportunity to demonstrate your problem-solving skills, which employers will want to see during interviews. Once again, the user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:

* Use React for the front end.

* Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

* Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

* Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Include authentication (JWT).

* Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

* Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

```

## Why this project is important
This final project allows us to show off all the skill we learn thus far while in Coding Bootcamp and also allows us to demonstrate to potential future employers what we are capable of.


## Actions taken for this project
- Created web application using React, GraphQl, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose ODM, queries/mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data, HTML, CSS (bootstrap), and Heroku deployment 
- Used git commands to add, commit, and push all changes on to GitHub repository
